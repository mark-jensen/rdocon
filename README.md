RDoCOn is being developed to integrate existing biomedical ontologies with findings derived from research that is aligned with the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC). RDoCOn is being developed to align with OBO Foundry ontologies within a realism-based methodology. It is in an early stage of development and content will change quickly.
